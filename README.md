# Avatars

When I created [my account](https://github.com/impurify) on Microsoft Github, I put effort into creating the perfect avatar.  Then, I realized that:

1. Github deleted the metadata that I added with `exiftool`.  Casual plagiarism of images is rampant online.  It is unacceptable to me for my avatar to be published without metadata.  (TODO: File a ticket with Github about this.)  I will change my avatar; however, I want a handy place to archive my old avatar, which I will elsewhere as a personal trademark.

2. I should change my Github avatar anyway, for political reasons.  The new one will be my public domain respin of the iconic 1990s vintage EFF Blue Ribbon.  I will offer several options, and encourage others to use them.

This needs its own `git` repository!

* **WWW:**  *Not yet.*  I obviously have a great domain for that—and from my recent need to find a memorable Github username, I serendipitously discovered that `impurify.com` and `impurify.me` were available.  I will probably have some various websites.
