## Free Speech Blue Ribbon Avatars

The Internet [has defeated threats to free speech before](https://web.archive.org/web/19971114041230/http://www.eff.org/pub/Legal/Cases/ACLU_v_Reno/19970626_eff_cda.announce).  Will it [do it again](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/23-1122.html)?  That’s only one case, but it’s an important one—and as online freedom of speech is now under concerted attack from multiple directions, the Net doesn’t seem to care like it used to.

Once upon a time, [the EFF’s original Blue Ribbon Campaign](https://web.archive.org/web/19971024171609/http://www.eff.org/blueribbon.html) was the fourth most-linked page on the entire Web.  Let’s return to those values!  I’ve scraped a bundle of old blue ribbon GIFs that I intend to optimize for today’s Web.  Meanwhile, I’ve made some blue ribbon avatars for use on Github and other social media.

Click to get the actual avatar files, lovingly optimized with `zopflipng` on crazy settings:

I encourage others to use these as their avatars here and elsewhere.  I didn’t create the original graphics, and I dedicate my modifications to the public domain.

For a vintage Nineties look, I’ve intentionally made those pixellated.  I’m also interested in fresh blue ribbons, especially vector graphics.  A blue ribbon SVG would be great.  Given the place of the Blue Ribbon Campaign in Net history, I’m also interested in creating a blue ribbon emoji—starting in the Unicode Private Use Area.  Please contact me if you have the needed graphic art skills and you want to help.

## Proprietary

Stuff I created for my own use is in directory [`proprietary`](/proprietary/README.md).
