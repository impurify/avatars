The blue ribbon GIFs in this directory were downloaded by me from archives of [the EFF’s original Blue Ribbon Campaign](https://web.archive.org/web/19971024171609/http://www.eff.org/blueribbon.html).

Wheee, old files!

```

```

I intend to convert all of the old blue ribbon files to maximally-compressed PNG or other better formats, republish them, and promote their use in the same way that they were used in the Nineties.  I’ll probably do that elsewhere; [Microsoft Github is not a place for free speech](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-sexually-obscene-content).  These two are merely the sources for a starter set of avatars.
